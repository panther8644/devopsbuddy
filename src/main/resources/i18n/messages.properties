copy.project.lead.intro=I am an eager to learn coder, who is looking to switch into a different field related to programming. \
  Up until now I have mostly worked in just python and C++, but have recently been researching and working through many other\
  languages. These now include: Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and implementing AWS for hosting. I am still learning more every day\
  and will continue to do so until I am hired in my new location, Portland Oregon.
